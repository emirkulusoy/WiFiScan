# WiFi Scan Script
	This bash script is designed to collect WiFi information (SSID,SSID-HEX,MODE,CHAN,FREQ,RATE,SIGNAL,SECURITY,WPA-FLAGS,RSN-FLAGS,DEVICE,ACTIVE,IN-USE).Â 
	It returns static data with an ID column for each iteration. These IDs are needed while changing this static data to vector data via QGIS Python.
	The script runs until you type "ctrl+C" on the command line and keep adding new test output to the same file. It creates a new file whenever you stop the bash and run it again.

# Prerequisites/Troubleshooting:
    nmcli: Make sure nmcli (NetworkManager command-line tool) is installed on your system.
    Bash: The script is written for the Bash shell.
    Permission Issues: Make sure you have the required rights to run sudo nmcli if you experience permission problems.

# Usage
    To make the bash file executable, please run the command below (please update version#):
		chmod +x WiFiScan_vA_0_0_1.bash
	Then you can simply run bash as below:
		sudo ./WiFiScan_vA_0_0_1.bash
    To stop the Script: 
		Type "ctrl+C"
